# simple-algorithm-visualizer

A fun, interactive Python application that visually demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm in real time. This project makes understanding sorting algorithms more engaging by animating each step of the sorting process using matplotlib.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch Bubble Sort in action as it organizes random data.
- **Interactive Animation:** See each swap and iteration update dynamically.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code:** Easy-to-understand code with clear comments, perfect for learning sorting algorithms and Python visualization.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9** (or later)
- **Conda** (optional, but recommended for managing your environment)

## Setup

### Using Conda

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alanconstantino/simple-algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd simple-algorithm-visualizer
